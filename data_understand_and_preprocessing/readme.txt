Part 1: Understanding & Preprocessing Data

1. Understanding the Data

  Identify where the data comes from (databases, files, APIs, web scraping).
  
  Study metadata: meaning of each column, units, data types, and origins.
  
  Clarify what each row and column represents.
  
  Perform descriptive statistics to detect anomalies or unusual patterns.

2. Data Cleaning

  Handle missing values (remove or fill with suitable values).
  
  Correct inconsistent data types (e.g., numbers stored as text, date formats).
  
  Detect and manage outliers (errors or rare but valid events).

3. Preparing for Analysis

  Create new features (e.g., extract month, weekday from date).
  
  Encode categorical variables into numerical format for modeling.

✨ Summary:
This stage ensures that raw data becomes reliable, consistent, and structured. The goal is to transform messy data into a clean and meaningful dataset that is ready for analysis or machine learning.
